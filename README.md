# Squads Quickstart

This repository provides a quickstart guide to interact with the Squads Protocol using TypeScript. It demonstrates how to create a multisig, propose a transaction, vote on it, and execute it on the Solana blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20.xx or above recommended)
- Yarn or npm
- Solana CLI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd squads-quickstart
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up your Solana environment:

   - Ensure you have the Solana CLI installed.
   - Start a local validator or set your environment to Devnet.

## Running the Demo

1. Compile the TypeScript code:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Visualizing Transactions

After running the script, you can visualize your transactions on the Solana Explorer by pasting their signature in the search bar.
